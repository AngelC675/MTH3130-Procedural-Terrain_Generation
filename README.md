This Python program is a basic terrain generator that uses Perlin noise to simluate 
the kind of terrain generation used in games such as Minecraft, but on a much smaller scale. 
The program is meant to showcase how certain methods of linear algebra are used to accomplish this. 
This program was written as a part of a project for the course MTH3130: "Applied Methods in 
Linear Algebra" at MSU Denver in the Fall semester of 2025.
